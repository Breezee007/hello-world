# hello-world

Hello Guys!
I am Chris, from Liberia.
I am a participant of the Online Google Certification Program, through PluralSight.
I'm participating/studying as a Mobile Web Developer, and I'm new to Programming.
Nevertheless, it's good to be aboard and part of the big family.
Thanks for having me here.
